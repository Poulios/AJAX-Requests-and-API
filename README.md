## AJAX requests 
and 
## API docs
An application that takes the city name, that you have provided in the form field, and returns data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) and attractions from [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs).

For OpenWeather, follow the instructions for the registration process: [How to start](https://openweathermap.org/guide/#how). When prompted, use your first name, and other for the OpenWeather questions for their data collection. OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in main.js. 

For Foursquare, once you make an account, create a new [app](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and fill out the form (you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field). The Foursquare API will then give you a client ID and a client secret. You’ll need to save both of those in main.js.
